🚴 Bike Sales Dashboard
📌 Project Overview    
This project demonstrates the process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing sales data using Excel.
The dataset contains information about bike buyers, demographics, and purchase decisions. 
The final dashboard provides an interactive view of insights such as buyer trends, age categories, commute distances, and income groups.

📂 File Structure

The Excel file contains 4 sheets:

1. bike_buyers (Raw Data)
   Contains the original dataset.
   Includes demographic details such as age, income, marital status, commute distance, etc.
   Raw and unprocessed data with missing/duplicate values.

2. Working Sheet (Data Cleaning)
   Removed duplicates and blanks
   Standardized categorical values (e.g., "M"/"Male")
   Corrected inconsistencies in data entries
   Added calculated fields (Age brackets, commute groups, etc.)

3.Pivot table
  Pivot tables created for key insights.
  Metrics analyzed:
      Average income of buyers vs non-buyers.
      Bike purchases across different commute distances.
      Purchases by marital status and children.
      Age categories vs purchase behavior.

4.Dashborad (Interactive Dashboard)
